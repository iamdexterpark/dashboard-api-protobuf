# dashboard-api-protobuf
This repository contains a protobuf definition that serves as an example, generated from the Meraki Dashboard API v3 specification.


## Overview
This repository represents the outcome of research efforts aimed at exploring the feasibility of representing the Meraki Dashboard API using a protobuf definition. 
It accomplishes this by taking the existing Meraki OpenAPI v3 specification and converting it into a protocol buffer message structure.
